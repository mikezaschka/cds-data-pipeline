# Examples

Six small, self-contained examples — one per plugin entry point — built on top of two shared backend services. Each example is a runnable CAP app: its own `package.json`, `db/`, `srv/`, `http/` scenarios, `start.sh`, and a README that walks through one feature of `cds-data-pipeline`.

Each example is meant to include the two monitor UIs (Fiori Elements **Pipeline Monitor** and the freestyle **Pipeline Console** with `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`) so you can watch runs, error counts, and statistics in a browser at `http://localhost:<port>/launchpage.html` (the launchpad has a tile for each app).

**One shared implementation** lives in [`_ui-pipeline/`](_ui-pipeline/): two UI5 Tooling 3 projects (`pipeline-monitor`, `pipeline-console`, TypeScript + `ui5 build`). Every example’s `package.json` links them with **`file:`** devDependencies; **[cds-plugin-ui5](https://github.com/ui5-community/ui5-ecosystem-showcase/tree/main/packages/cds-plugin-ui5)** serves them at `/pipeline-monitor` and `/pipeline-console` on the same origin as the CAP server. The sandbox `launchpage.html` is a single file in `_ui-pipeline/`; each example’s `app/launchpage.html` is a **symlink** to it. After changing the UIs, run `npm run ui:build` in any example (or `cd examples/_ui-pipeline && npm install && npm run build`).

## Shared substrate

- `_providers/` — two reusable backends (LogisticsService CAP V4, FXService REST) plus a `start-providers.sh` script. See [_providers/README.md](_providers/README.md).
- `_ui-pipeline/` — Fiori monitor + FCL console + launchpad (TypeScript, **cds-plugin-ui5**). See [_ui-pipeline/README.md](_ui-pipeline/README.md). Fiori list/object **annotations** for the management service live in the plugin at [`srv/monitor-annotations.cds`](../srv/monitor-annotations.cds) (not under `_ui-pipeline/`).

4456  FXService                       — used by 02 only
```

## Running an example

Each example has a self-contained `start.sh` that launches its required providers and the example consumer on the matching `410x` port. Stop with `Ctrl+C`.

```bash
# Pick any example; its README is the walkthrough
bash examples/01-replicate-odata/start.sh

# Visit http://localhost:4101/launchpage.html for the Pipeline Monitor and Pipeline Console,
# and http://localhost:4101/odata/v4/... for the example's own OData service.
# Run the .http scenarios in examples/01-replicate-odata/http/ via the
# VS Code REST Client extension.
```

## Relationship to the docs

Each example README opens with a one-line anchor to the doc page it expands on. The docs are the reference; the examples show one end-to-end configuration plus its observable output. Code snippets in the docs are intentionally self-contained — the examples add the runnable wiring (CAP service file, HTTP scenarios, Pipeline Monitor setup) around them.

A custom source / target adapter is intentionally not included here — the code lives in [Custom source](../docs/guide/sources/custom.md) and [Custom target](../docs/guide/targets/custom.md) and adds little that the six above don't already cover.
